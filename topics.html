<p>A URL(Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access resources on the internet,such as webpages,images,files,or services. It specifies the location of a resource on the internet and how to retrieve it.A URL is often referred to as a "web address".</p>

<h1><center><u>Agile Methodology</u><center></h1>
<p>An agile methodology is an iterative approach to software development. Each iteration of agile methodology takes a short time interval of 1 to 4 weeks. The agile development process is aligned to deliver the changing business requirement. It distributes the software with faster and fewer changes.

The single-phase software development takes 6 to 18 months. In single-phase development, all the requirement gathering and risks management factors are predicted initially.

The agile software development process frequently takes the feedback of workable product. The workable product is delivered within 1 to 4 weeks of iteration.</p>

<h1><center><u>Waterfall Methodology</u><center></h1>
<p>Waterfall methodology is a well-established project management workflow. Like a waterfall, each process phase cascades downward sequentially through five stages (requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance).

The methodology comes from computer scientist Winston Royce’s 1970 research paper on software development. Although Royce never named this model “waterfall”, he gets credit for creating a linear, rigorous project management system.  

Unlike other methods, such as the Agile methodology, Waterfall doesn't allow flexibility. You must finish one phase before beginning the next. Your team can’t move forward until they resolve any problems. Moreover, as our introduction to project management guide outlines, your team can’t address bugs or technical debt if it’s already moved on to the next project phase.</p><center>

<h1><center><u>DevOps</u><center></h1>
<p>DevOps is a set of practices that unites software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, streamline workflows, and enhance the speed and quality of software delivery. The core principles of DevOps include automation, continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and collaboration.<center>

<h1><center><u>SDLC</u><center></h1>
<p>
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured process used by software developers and project managers to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications. It defines the stages or phases involved in developing software from initial planning to maintenance. The SDLC ensures that software is delivered efficiently, meets quality standards, and aligns with business objectives.</p>

Key Phases of the SDLC:<br>
<b>1.Planning:</b>

Identify project goals, requirements, and scope.
Develop a project plan and allocate resources.<br>
<b>2.Feasibility Study:</b>

Assess the technical, operational, and financial feasibility of the project.
Ensure that the project is viable and aligns with business needs.<br>
<b>3.System Design:</b>

Create detailed architecture, design specifications, and user interfaces.
Design the database schema, software components, and workflows.<br>
<b>4.Development:</b>

Write the actual code based on the design specifications.
Developers implement features and functionality.<br>
<b>5.Testing:</b>

Conduct various tests (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) to ensure the software works as intended.
Identify and fix defects or bugs.<br>
<b>6.Deployment:</b>

Deploy the software to production environments.
Perform final checks and ensure proper functioning.<br>
<b>7.Maintenance:</b>

Provide ongoing support and updates.
Fix bugs, patch security vulnerabilities, and add new features over time.
