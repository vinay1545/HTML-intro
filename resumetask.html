<h4>Lighting enhancement of underwater image using coronavirus herd 
immunity optimizer</h4>
<p>Underwater Imaging Challenges:Light absorption, scattering, and floating micro-particles cause poor image quality, leading to low contrast, blurriness, and color distortion in underwater images.<br>

CHIO-UIE Method:The study proposes a new enhancement technique using the Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimizer (CHIO) algorithm to improve underwater image quality by enhancing contrast, restoring details, and reducing distortion.<br>

Effective Results:The proposed CHIO-UIE method demonstrates significant improvements in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, enhancing the visual quality of underwater images across various marine environments.</p>
